                <h1>SMART WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING IOT(Internet of Things)</h1>
                <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept in which surrounding objects are connected through wired and wireless networks without user intervention. In the field of IoT, the objects communicate and exchange information to provide advanced intelligent services for users.
                    This project deals with the problem of Waste management in smart cities, where the garbage collection system is not optimized. This project enables the organizations to meet their needs of smart garbage management system. This system allows the user to know the fill level of each garbage bin in a locality or city at all time, to give a cost effective and time saving route to the truck drivers.<br> Internet of Things (IoT) is a new and promising technology, which has the potential to globally change human life in a positive way, thanks to its diverse connectivity. IoT provides exchange and linkage between low-energy devices and interactions through the Internet. Many applications around the world have been implementing different operations, based on the background of IoT, to offer novel services for smart cities  and optimize energetic efficiency.<br></p>

                    INTRODUCTION(What is Waste management)
                </h2>
                <p>Along with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), waste management has appeared as a serious issue. Waste management is a daily task in urban areas, which requires a large amount of labour resources and affects natural, budgetary, efficiency, and social aspects.<br>We examine data transfer on the LoRa module and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed system, which is implemented through a simple circuit designed with low cost, ease of use, and replace ability. Our system saves time by finding the best route in the management of waste collection.</br></p>

                    EXPRIMENTAL RESULT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering the advantages of IoT technologies, many researchers have investigated and developed new applications for smart cities, especially for waste management. To save power consumption and maximize operational time, a simple system that identifies the fullness of trash bins was presented, which collected data and delivered it through a wireless mesh network . However, the idea has still some ambiguous problems in the system. To improve waste management, platform software for smart cities has been introduced in ; however, they only concentrated on the collection of data, and their platforms were comprised of technologies from other companies.<br> OBJECTIVES
                    The key research objectives are as follows:
                    <br>• The proposed system would be able to automate the solid waste monitoring process and management of the overall collection process using IOT (Internet of Things).
                    <br>• The Proposed system consist of main subsystems namely Smart Trash System(STS) and Smart Monitoring and Controlling Hut(SMCH).
                    <br>• In the proposed system, whenever the waste bin gets filled this is acknowledged by placing the circuit at the waste bin, which transmits it to the receiver at the desired place in the area or spot.
                    <br>• In the proposed system, the received signal indicates the waste bin status at the monitoring and controlling system.<br>

                    CONCLUSION
                </h2>
                <p>In this work, an optimal algorithm combining graph theory and LR has been described, with the possibility of assessing the probability of a trash bin being fully based on the number of classes in the university. This algorithm presents many advantages, as compared with the old waste collection methods. In addition, this study also provides improvements over classical algorithms.<br>The project designed is a part of the implication that can be used to improve the waste management of a locality. All the technical aspects have been thoroughly designed keeping all the constraints in mind. The project resolves around whether the project will be able to meet the future needs of the users. This project based on IOT gives user the freedom of changing hardware as well as software specifications as per the arising need. IOT based projects are already designed while keeping future demands in mind and in rising economy like India where the concept of smart cities is new the demand of our project will keep on increasing</p>
